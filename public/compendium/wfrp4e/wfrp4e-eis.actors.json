			"description": "<p>Granny is a wizened, white-haired, professionally grumpy old woman. She’s aware that a portion of her livelihood depends upon yokels taking her for a genuine witch with real magical powers. She plays the role to the hilt with relish. Her clothes are a ragged accumulation of many colours and fabrics, and her curly hair is teased into a wild mane, with beads, bones and other small objects braided in here and there. Her three remaining teeth are a deep greyish-yellow, and one bright-blue eye peers out from behind a lock of hair that almost always hangs down over her berry-brown, wrinkled face.</p>\n                         <blockquote>\n                         <p><strong><em>Quotes</em></strong>: ‘No, no, no. You don’t build the fire like that.’</p>\n                         <p>‘When you’ve lived as long as I have, then you can tell me how to do a job.’</p>\n                         <p>‘When I was a girl, we listened to older people.

If she ever had a family, she never speaks of them. Growing older, she noticed that the young and gullible took more interest in her ‘herbal preparations’ than in her mundane goods. Since the young and gullible are a group easily separated from their money, she cashed in on her age and natural acting talents to sell charms and potions, all of them bogus, to the sick and lovelorn across the Empire. Wolfgang treats her well, gives her a fair share of the take in return for her cooking, and lets her peddle her charms on the side. This makes the carnival one of the most comfortable jobs she’s ever had. The presence of the beastmen lends even more credibility to her wise-woman image, making for better trade than ever before. This is a good life, by her standards, and she wants it to last and, ‘see her out’.&nbsp;</p>"

What&rsquo;s more, &lsquo;accidental&rsquo; deaths surround wherever the drop was done: drownings, broken skulls, impalements, the whole spectrum. Pf&ouml;rtner&rsquo;s getting worried, and not least of all because, as least as far as his employers are concerned, he keeps 'missing' drops.

She regularly hawks phlegm when she talks, constantly blinks like an owl in daylight, and continually spins a worn shilling over her knuckles (with remarkable skill).

Caught red-handed with an icon of Stromfels, Zimmermann has been sentenced to death by drowning — a traditional punishment for heresy against the Cult of Manann. The Characters know better though; while slipping past on ‘business’ of their own, they saw her pilfer the icon, along with a selection of other goods, from another individual. They also know that Zimmermann knows far more than she’s letting on, for there are signs of a plot brewing that could send the Reik’s economy&nbsp; into turmoil, ruining the lives of countless people, and worse, the Characters’ interests!

Depending on events, Zimmermann’s reports may bring some help from the Crooked Fingers when most needed. Indeed, in such a case, Alette may well end up being one of the only folk in town that knows the Characters are innocent of the things they will likely be accused of, and may well deliver some of the concluding lines to Enemy in Shadows, if they stop the Ritual and must flee:</em></p>\n                    <p>‘I know what ya done.

Vastly talented but dark of mood, Zindrisson could easily be described as an archetypal Dwarf — except that he is self-aware of his own deficiencies, and desperately trying to fix them in unorthodox ways. Brokur will take challenging smithing commissions no ‘respectable’ Dwarf would ever even consider, the more unusual, the better. He is always on the lookout for ‘unusual’ materials that could be useful for his work.</p>\n                    <h4>I Never Asked for This</h4>\n                    <p>Though, by all accounts, a perfectly upstanding Dwarf, Zindrisson is nonetheless on the run. Disgraced before he was born, by a father he never met, Brokur, son of Zindri, is the inheritor of a Grudge that compels him towards certain death, and likely, a legacy of dishonour himself. Well, Zindrisson isn’t sitting around, waiting to be dragged away by the Reckoners, nor is he about to shave his scalp, take up arms, and sell his life in a futile quest. He needs conspirators — free agents, with a knack for deception — to fake his death and free him from his familial oaths.&nbsp;</p>\n                    <blockquote>\n                    <h3><em>The Shadow Cast - Iron Flowers</em></h3>\n                    <p><em>Zindrisson makes for a useful and fun encounter, especially since starting Characters will frequently seek out a smith to pick up a decent weapon the first chance they get. He can easily be placed in either Altdorf or the Schaffenfest — or both, as he does travel to large events on occasion. At first he seems a ‘typical Dwarf smith’ as he spears customers a sharp glance from beneath his big, bushy, black brows.&nbsp;</em></p>\n                    <p><em>Perceptive Characters will swiftly realise all his wares bear the hallmarks of strange and rare craftsmanship. Zindrisson sells intricate ‘iron flowers’ that are especially favoured by nobles. Many of his smithwork pieces and weapons are laced with an unusual green metal. Several have odd flourishes and weird engravings. Indeed, he is willing to sell some of his more&nbsp;‘experimental projects’ at a fraction of their normal&nbsp;cost, so long as the Characters promise to speak&nbsp;well of his weapons and tell everyone where they&nbsp;got them.</em></p>\n                    </blockquote>"

The von Durbheims &mdash; the original rulers of the now dissolved province of S&ouml;lland &mdash; were said to have died out in 1707 IC, but the &lsquo;Grand Baronet&rsquo; holds firm to his title. Of course, he&rsquo;s little better than an impoverished rake in finery going to rags, but an idea is often more important than reality in the Empire. Eberhart wastes no opportunity to remind everyone of this idea.</p>\n<h4>Lines on Pfeildorf</h4>\n<p>Whilst sitting down to a meal and a drink at a coaching inn, a minstrel strikes up a rendition of Lines on Pfeildorf, a ballad lamenting the loss of the province of S&ouml;lland, and the presence of a foreign Countess &mdash; @Actor[CcqiAghkzgp9u1In]{Emmanuelle von Liebwitz} &mdash; sitting on the throne. The taproom falls to listening, but not everyone looks on happily.

Knives are drawn, tables are overturned, and the taproom explodes into a brawl. Eberhart demands that everyone choose where they stand and suggests great rewards for those that join him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Shadow Cast - Status Quo</em></h3>\n<p><em>The striking von Durbheim can be used for extra background colour in @JournalEntry[4WEhiObwXJKErVFi]{Altdorf} or at @JournalEntry[CK4GguuIqzMioEq3]{The Schaffenfest}.

At some point, one or more of the audience&nbsp;</em><em>(clearly not of the gentry) gets fed up with the &lsquo;Grand Baronet&rsquo; and denounces him. Von Durbheim regards the individual for a moment, then draws his foil and runs them through in a single smooth motion, killing them on the spot. He gestures to a nearby watchman, &lsquo;deal with this&rsquo; then flips a single shilling on to the body before sauntering away, casually drinking from a glass of ale that he takes from someone In the crowd. Nobody stops him, nobody says a word.

After much debate, Teugen eventually agreed.<br>However, unknown to Teugen, not only will he never be able to reclaim his soul — Gideon lied about that — but the ritual to swap seven souls for his own actually opens a gateway into the Realm of Chaos — Gideon lied about that, too!</span></p>\n                                        <p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gideon is a master illusionist and can take other forms. Its natural form appears like a @Actor[iDy8SDTwJSlCzZMl]{Pink Horror of Tzeentch} with a constant ripple of magic surrounding it — a multi-armed, pink-fleshed Daemon, with a gaping, fang-filled maw and evershifting tentacles. However, Gideon is not like most&nbsp; Daemons of Tzeentch. It is not a crazed, gibbering creature of unrestrained magic. Gideon is much more cunning. It was spun from the greed of others by its master for a specific purpose. Gideon is ambitious, clever, and resourceful, and it works towards its master’s goals with a singular purpose that would terrify Teugen if only he understood.</span></p>\n                                        <p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In the early months in Nuln, the Daemon most commonly wore the flesh of Nina Dietrich, a famous actress of the @Scene[g07sPqjuua3lSWLk]{Staatsoper Theatre}, and a favourite of Teugen. That was before the deal was struck, before Teugen was offered the world and more as the Daemon whispered sweet promises in his ear. After the deal, the daemon took on the persona of Gideon, a distant cousin of Teugen’s. He appears as a tall, slim, impeccably dressed Human man with dark hair and a handsome face dominated by intense eyes. The character the Daemon projects as Gideon is sardonic, and it feigns a quirky, ironic sense of humour. While it seldom, if ever, actually laughs, there is always a wry, faintly supercilious smile playing about its lips.</span></p>\n                                        <p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">For all it knows it shouldn’t, the Daemon is thoroughly enjoying its sojourn in the Mortal Realm. Lately, Gideon has taken to appearing as a child when around Teugen, and chewing a great deal of garlic, as it knows both irritate the man immensely. Over the years, the Daemon’s pretence of amusement at the greed and gullibility of mortals has become quite real, and is exceeded only by its relish at the thought of its imminent triumph when Teugen’s ritual — the one the fool thinks will save his soul — actually opens a Chaos Gate in the heart of the Reikland. Its master will be so pleased.</span></p>"

Now I wonder what would happen if…’</p>\n                         </blockquote>\n                         <p>Wolfgang comes across as a studious, quietly inquisitive man who enjoys listening and watching more than talking except, that is, when he is earning money with his menagerie. At this point, his inner showman comes to the fore. He can’t help but make grand announcements to get the customers in, no matter how spurious.&nbsp;</p>\n                         <p>Wolfgang is driven by the need to understand. He wants to know causes as much as effects, even if this involves him in matters that are none of his concern. He’s a natural busybody where people are concerned, but he always manages to be discreet: knowing and telling are two very different things. This single-mindedness has proved useful in his long-term profession as a spy. Over the years Wolfgang has proved his worth to noble families and city guilds. He specialises in what might be termed ‘commercial work’, and is expert at ferreting out the true wealth or debts of an individual, a family, a guild, or even a whole town! Such information often proves valuable in trade. He has spied for many wealthy people, and makes it a policy to be completely close-mouthed about this aspect of his life. Even Benbow knows only that his master misses very little. His need for knowledge is also what has lead him in such a curious career path: starting all over again as an apprentice in search of knowledge was not easy, but he did it.</p>\n                         <p>Although he can be amoral in his quest for information, Wolfgang is not evil. He always honours his word once given, and the thought of needless suffering upsets him tremendously. That said, his curiosity does have one (possibly unfortunate) side effect: he can sometimes seem very cruel when his work is involved. Wolfgang is quite capable of vivisecting something in the cause of Knowledge, all the while muttering over his victim that it is a high honour to be advancing ‘Learning’ in this fashion. It’s the facts that he wants, not his subject’s death.</p>\n                         <p>Wolfgang will be a cool and collected opponent should he cross swords (metaphorically speaking) with the Characters, and should be played as such. He will use any and all his skills to gain an advantage. He is capable of assessing risks and benefits accurately in all circumstances. He is not above running away if the occasion requires, and can be used as an ongoing enemy if this happens.</p>"

			"description": "<p></p>\n<p>Wolmar Rotte is incorrigible. A scoundrel of the highest order. A right and thorough scamp. Once, he sold a merchant prince some rock candy stained blue, claiming it was, &lsquo;A sea sapphire from furthest Ulthuan&rsquo;. On another occasion, he tricked Trancas Quendalmanliye, a famous casino owner from Marienburg, into letting him deal his own cards in a game of Ranald&rsquo;s Fingers&hellip; Needless to say, he&rsquo;s not allowed back within the city walls. Rotte is an entirely unassuming man in his middle years, but has a knack for taking up just enough room to get what he wants and get away without any consequences (usually).</p>\n<h4>Rotten to the Core&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Some people are just born lucky, blessed by Ranald. Others, well, they take their luck from far darker forces. However, they don&rsquo;t always know where their luck comes from, and for a con man, being duped is by far the biggest shame. Rotte doesn&rsquo;t remember when it happened, or how he even started down the path, but now he&rsquo;s got a daemon on his back with strange demands and an appetite for souls. The daemon wants its demands taken care of and every once in a while, a soul to consume. It doesn&rsquo;t care whose soul, just so long as it gets fed&hellip; And then the Characters walk into Rotte&rsquo;s current haunt asking questions. It won&rsquo;t take much: a win, a loss, a draw, and a drop of blood on the Ace of Hammers&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Shadow Cast - Stained Fingers</em></h3>\n<p><em>Rotte can be used as an alternate for @Actor[RXY98JwsYTfmOfGa]{Phillipe Descartes} in @JournalEntry[rFwZDOZt8BbBLbz2]{The Coach and Horses Inn}, especially if your group is already familiar with the Bretonnian gambler. Unlike Descartes, Rotte isn&rsquo;t much of a fighter. He is far more ruthless though, and more dangerous than he appears, for Wolmar is an agent of Chaos. While the Purple Hand will certainly show up again late in the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> Campaign, you&rsquo;ve likely noticed that they have no presence in B&ouml;genhafen (well, other than the hapless &lsquo;Kastor&rsquo;). You can change that if you add Rotte as their senior agent in town, one tasked with looking into the magister impedimentae&rsquo;s &lsquo;betrayal&rsquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>He may, instead, be an agent of @JournalEntry[RBX3qFUfnzGnyfoq]{The Vigilant Eye} or another cult entirely, such as @JournalEntry[Blt8xV4eWWRHpKfm]{The Shifting Grasp} or @JournalEntry[1BWwa8sb98UZC5By]{The Faceless Ones}. If such is the case, he may be looking to disrupt the ritual as well &mdash; though certainly not for any altruistic reasons &mdash; and will doubtless try to con the Characters into achieving his aims, casting them aside the second they cease to be useful.</em></p>\n</blockquote>"
