It was overrun thousands of years ago and has been held by a succession of Orc warlords ever since. Agna gripes that the Dwarfs of Middenheim pay lip service to the reclamation of the hold, but are tardy about doing anything.</p>\n<p>When very drunk Agna claims that the High King also plans to claim the Fauschlag. Should she mention this, any other Dwarfs within earshot insist that she is mad with drink and usher her off to bed. However, Agna insists that the High King rightly regards @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Grungni's Tower} as part of his Everlasting Realm and is prepared to make war upon those who would deny it to him. Sober again, she denies knowledge of such ambitions.</p>"

He stalks the burrows dressed in the rusted steel of an elite Skaven warrior, and should any tarry in his path, they suffer a jab from his hook hand or the searing agony of his sting.</p>\n<p>Gnawretch was once the model of a Skaven Warrior: tall, muscular, with a thick, dark pelt. Renowned for his ruthless resilience, on campaign in the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains he suffered pangs of black hunger and consumed his own tail and left hand. A dark perseverance alone let him survive the injuries and earned him the respect of lesser Skaven. Warlord-General Paskrit brought Gnawretch into his service, severing his clan ties and extending his life through warpstone elixirs. Gnawretch grew a new tail, tipped with a lurid-yellow sting. He hasn&rsquo;t been so fortunate regarding his hand, a wears a cruel prosthetic hook.</p>\n<p>Like all the best tyrants, Gnawretch is a consummate bureaucrat and an enthusiastic enforcer of quotas and schedules. Should a Scrutens foraging party arrive back late, or Moulder researchers requisition more warpstone than their due, he logs the discrepancy and delivers swift punishment.

An underling who offends him once loses his left eye, and those who fail him twice are left sightlessly groping around the warrens, doomed to be killed and eaten by former comrades.</p>\n<p>Gnawretch focuses on winning glory through efficient management of @JournalEntry[YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}.

Much of this he consumes himself, but he stores the remainder as gifts to Clan Skryre in the hope that they will lend support to the project. He also continually petitions the council to allow him to dig breeding pits and a temple to the Horned Rat, all in the hope of improving the prospect and reputation of the lair.</p>\n<p>But the council demand results first. They want Gnawretch to discover the sources of Middenheim&rsquo;s water supply and whatever it is that fuels the Eternal Flame. Gnawretch sends scouting parties up into the tunnels above for this purpose, but with no success. Those exploring the areas Gnawretch suspects will yield results are assailed by a gigantic adversary, the nature of which is not clear to the Skaven.
