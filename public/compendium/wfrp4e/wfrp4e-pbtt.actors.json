A tall man in his early 60s, gaunt and ascetic, he has a long mane of thick glossy black hair, without a hint of grey despite his age, and piercing eyes of a startlingly vivid blue. His eyes, and his long, delicate-but-strong fingers, are his most defining features. He makes a lasting impression on anyone he meets. When not donning the ceremonial gear of his order, Helscher dresses with a lack of vanity, preferring free flowing garments in black or grey which allow him maximum freedom of movement. He is more concerned with abstractions and his research than with &lsquo;real life&rsquo;, and rarely leaves his apartments and offices in the guildhouse. Consequently, he is little seen by the general populace, who regard him as a mysterious figure to be feared rather than loved.</p>"

Nobody looked that way, so I knew it was what I was after and glided over to it. The great bulk of Alfric was squeezed in there, with one of his henchmen and a fat human in opulent robes sat opposite. The table was covered with empty tankards on the Dwarfs&rsquo; side, and gold coins. Alfric looked up. There was more grey in his beard than I remembered, and the scars around his ruined nose were a flaming red: a sure sign he&rsquo;d been drinking heavily. But it would be unwise for me to assume he&rsquo;d be drunk, or unobservant.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Good evening, brother,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Sit down. How may I be of service to the Temple of Morr this evening?&rsquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&mdash; Hammers of Ulric, by Dan Abnett and James Wallis</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p><em>Another character from the Hammers of Ulric novel, Alfric is a blackmailer and information broker, but his services do not come free of cost or risk.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Power Behind the Throne</h3>\n<p>The intrigues and operations of Middenheim&rsquo;s criminal underworld are of little interest to its Dwarf population. They are honourable traditionalists in the main, and do not care to sully their reputations by getting involved with any sort of criminal activity. Few Dwarfs would sink so low as to work for gangs of organised human criminals, and to be discovered doing so would shame many of them into seeking out honourable death as a Slayer.</p>\n<p>Alfric, though, is among the few exceptions.&nbsp; A grizzled Dwarf who looks older than his years (and he is by no means a beardling) he has offered his services to the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings} of Middenheim for longer than a Human generation. By and large Middenheim&rsquo;s Dwarf community shun Alfric, believing him a disgrace to his family and clan. A small coterie of less honourable Dwarfs, however, do seek him out and provide him with gossip, and the fact that he retains this tenuous link with the Dwarf community makes him a valuable asset as a fence and a trader in sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Much of Alfric&rsquo;s nose has been cut away. No one is sure why and the episode must have occurred in his youth, as he has been mutilated for as long as anyone in Middenheim can recall. He is a member of the Anvilbreaker family, and pretends a degree of sentiment about his blood relations (just to put people off guard a little, in truth he is too cynical to care). He has a black beard shot through with grey streaks and his dark eyes glint like wet stones. He is not pleasant company, and sets great personal store on his identity as a bitter and insulting individual who belongs nowhere.</p>\n<h3>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</h3>\n<p>As his name suggests, much of Alfric&rsquo;s nose has been cut away. No one is sure how he came to be so disfigured, and Alfric isn&rsquo;t telling. One of the foremost blackmailers and informants in the city, Alfric carefully courts the favour of local @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{The Low Kings}, providing free information to the agents of both @JournalEntry[gy8z3RbyyEKaoJ2e]{Bleyden, the Lowest King} and @JournalEntry[pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam Gouda}.</p>\n<p>If he feels that visiting Characters have interesting stories, he operates on a quid pro quo basis. Otherwise he sells information for between one and ten shillings depending on how juicy he thinks it is. He is able to relay anything known amongst the criminal community.</p>\n<p>Alfric has dealings with another information broker known only as Josef, and he is careful to ensure that neither one of them monopolises the market. Alfric deals in rumours about Middenheim&rsquo;s underworld whilst Josef specialises in high-society gossip. Alfric can corroborate a story Josef has sold, but only if Josef has been paid for it first. Josef is of no particular abode but Alfric knows how to find him, for a price.</p>"

Her father protested that he was no heretic and had not realised what he was selling, but the Witch Hunters burned him all the same. Brunhilde grew resentful of anyone with authority over her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She became a keen follower of Ranald, revering him in his role as a trickster deceiving the powerful.

Brunhilde informed the Merchants&rsquo; Guild of Stehlenhuhn&rsquo;s crimes and revelled in the ensuing chaos within the cult.

She works from the temple but is often out on religious business with the legal, educational, and magical authorities in the city.</p>\n<p>As an important cleric with a connection to the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, the Characters may be interested in meeting her to find out her role in the introduction of the tax. She is connected to the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords} as they are expected to pay respects to Verena in her capacity as Goddess of Justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edel is one of the more cynical NPCs in Middenheim&rsquo;s upper echelons. She takes a pessimistic view of city government and always assumes the worst of intentions in others. She is strongly opposed to the tax, but takes few positive steps towards its repeal as she believes that powerful people will do what they want with few consequences. However, Edel will lend support to the party if they&rsquo;re working against the taxes, even though she suspects they&rsquo;ll fail. She is well connected and can provide introductions to several key NPCs.</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the party to show an interest in the tax issue, you can use the Cult of Verena as a potential &lsquo;hook&rsquo; to involve the Characters in the adventure. An initiate of Verena can accost any Academic, Lawyer, or vaguely bookish Character in the street and thrust a printed pamphlet into their hand. They explain earnestly that the tax is doubly unfair on the Cult of Verena, as it affects the temple and the wizards who tend to congregate there. If they can help the cause, they can potentially have free access to the cult&rsquo;s extensive library. Any expression of interest gains an audience with Mueller, a sardonic lecture on futility, and her tacit support.</p>\n<p>The most senior priest of Verena in Middenheim, Edel is in her early forties, taller than average with a slim build. She has long black hair that she usually wears in two long plaits. Her eyes are dark brown.</p>\n<p>Edel Mueller&rsquo;s upbringing was within the Verenan faith and there was never any doubt that she would become a priestess. Both she and her sister left Middenheim to attend @JournalEntry[NARo7y1h82hx3cIV]{Altdorf University} before returning to take up posts in the city and @JournalEntry[Salzenmund], where her sister is now High Priestess. The two remain close, but with an undercurrent of rivalry.</p>\n<p>Mueller always looks a little sour or disappointed with the world around her. She can manage a wry smile or sarcastic quip, but charm does not come easy to her, and people tend to assume that she&rsquo;d rather be hidden in her study reading &mdash; which is entirely true. But she is not bitter and there are flashes of humour and friendliness when someone shares her interests or preoccupations.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Mueller&rsquo;s intelligence has given her a mistrust of power and a fatalism that can run counter to her faith. For many years she was a Scalebearer, the school of thought within the Cult that prioritises justice over learning. But as she became more jaded, she moved towards the Lorekeepers, who believe that salvation comes from knowledge. This personality change has manifested as a compulsion to collect books, particularly rare tomes. Her chambers in the temple are piled high with hundreds of folios, scrolls, and codices, threatening to topple over. She keeps her rarest or forbidden books in a locked antechamber.</p>"

This is a remarkable achievement for one who is a relative newcomer to Middenheim. His real identity is Gotthard von Wittgenstein, the only surviving member of a corrupt family of the Reikland nobility, and heavily involved with the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Slaaneshi Cult of the Jade Sceptre}. He managed to acquire his important public offices thanks to the patronage of the Cult Magus, the Graf&rsquo;s late wife Anika-Elise Nikse. Gotthard is a master of disguise. In his official roles, he wears rich clothing and tints his hair and beard red. Out and about in Middenheim, he has grey-black hair flecked with silver with a dark-brown trimmed beard, and dresses rather shabbily in blues and greys. His eyes are brown. As von Wittgenstein, he is blond-haired and blue-eyed, clean shaven and appears to be in his mid 20s. If approached, he will nearly always claim to be somebody else and suggest that it is a case of mistaken identity. Gotthard is lascivious, avaricious, sycophantic to those he feels he can benefit from, but rude to everyone else. He is not without cunning, having kept one step ahead of Middenheim&rsquo;s spies.</p>"

He has spent almost a year in @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, quietly seething at the indignity of it all, but has spent some time training the small militia in weapon drills and defensive strategy all the same. He has spent much more time courting @Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde Gudhoffen}.</p>\n<p>Parzival views the skull attacks as a gift from the gods, a chance for a Reikland noble to show some Middenlanders how to get things done. Unfortunately, the skulls have not played fair and he has not even seen one. He hungers for distraction, and greets any plan to go skull-hunting with enthusiasm. He is not without some sense, however, and will cooperate with any plan that looks like it will yield results, providing he has a prominent part to play. Despite his annoying personality, the Characters would do well to get him on their side.</p>"
