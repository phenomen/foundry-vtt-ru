To an attractive, well groomed young man with an artist's sensibilities, a city like Altdorf has so much more to offer than even the most impressive mountain vista. Still, Erich intends to make the best of things, and the expedition does offer many interesting subjects for his art. While studying illustration, Erich always had a particular appreciation for the animals depicted in the Bestiaries that are occssionally published in Altdorf. He naturally assumed they were accurate. Now, having seen some of these creatures in person and realised they look nothing like their depections, Erich is beginning to wonder if the artists he so admired had seen the creatures they claimed to depict at all!</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Son of a wealthy merchant from Tahme, Erich has never wanted for much in life, except inspiration and a cure for boredom. He was an indifferent merchant at best, but a fairly talented artist. His father has ordered him to accompany the Imperial Zoo's expedition in part because thier family sponsored it and he wishes to keep an eye on how his money is spent, but also because he hopes it will ‘toughen up’ his son and show him a bit of the world. Erich only got talked into it because he was assured some of his art could be in the final book — and because his father threatened to cut him off entirely if he didn’t agree.</p><h3>Secrets</h3><p>Your core secret is part of your Character, but you may choose additional secrets. You begin with an additional [[/r 1d10]] Silver Shillings for each additional secret chosen.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Secret:</strong> You are a true pacifist, and generally abhor violence.

Mix that in here and we'll both be joining the ancestors. Now, while I mix these, you go find the thing's liver. Shouldn't be hard, they have three.’</p></blockquote><p>Jorunn was once rather personable, at least by Dwarf standards. An unexpected betrayal by a trusted friend left her somewhat untrusting of those who seek her friendship. She walks with just a hint of stiffness that might indicate an old injury, but has no interesting in explaining her woes to those who ask. Jorunn wears her hair in practical braids, in the fashion of Karak Ziflin, and is always on the lookout for her kin in hopes of hearing word from home. While she has yet to finish her studies in the wider world, however, but does dream of one day returning to the hold bearing new alchemical secrets that will impress even the Dwarf elders who were so dismissive of her efforts.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jorunn hails from the Dwarf Hold Karak Ziflin in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}. Exceedingly intelligent and far more ‘scientifically’ minded then her peers, Jorunn at first trained as a healer, but eventually left to learn more than what her home could teach. She travelled into Kislev where she eventually apprenticed with a Wise Woman for a time, swapping herbal and healing knowledge. After several years, without warning, the Wise Woman tried to murder Jorunn, and the terrified and confused Dwarf was forced to kill the woman in self defence. As she fled back south into the Empire, she discovered that she had somehow been infected with a curious disease. She has spent the last few years adding to her lore by studying with various apothecaries, physicians, and scholars.</p><h3>Secrets</h3><p>Your core secret is part of your Character, but you may choose additional secrets.

She is fascinated with the unusual properties of various beasts – especially rare properties, even if they happen to be particularly dangerous. By the standards of most Wizards, Kistiane isn’t very scholarly. She talks more about ‘impressions’ of different creatures, and the various swirls and eddies they cause in the winds of magic. Kistiane is certain that magic can be used more productively in the Empire, for the good of all its citizens. She is reluctant to use harmful magic, and finds it somewhat distressing when she is forced to do so.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kistiane is the daughter of a successful @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf} family that found, to their dismay, that she had the ‘gift’ of magic.

Kistiane wants the citizens of the Empire to realize that magic can do a great deal of good for them and has put on free lectures in Altdorf to extol magic’s positive virtues. After a horrible accident involving experiments with a Bloodsedge specimen, Kistiane’s was 'encouraged' to go on a ‘sabbatical’ away from Altdorf for a time.

Perhaps all that's needed is to stretch ones legs and see some more of the human lands.

They fought in the Great War Against Chaos a mere two hundred years ago, serving as a scout on the very edges of the enemy lines and often beyond. The experience changed Lynathryn forever. While it was doublessly horrific, the war brought together a diverse alliance of Elves, Humans, and even Dwarfs, all in defiance of a common foe. This has left Lynathryn with an unusually plesant attitude toward non-elves, even this sometimes comes off as condescension. It was due to their experience, limited as it is, with Humans of the Empire, that the Queen has set Lynathryn forth once more to learn what they can of the current state of the world beyond their forest.

I'm certain I don't know what you mean. Now either step out of my light so I can see what I'm writing, or let's both step outside and get some air.’</p></blockquote><p>Theodosius has seen, if anything, a little too much of the Old World. His wirey frame and scholarly dress disguise the fact that he is surprisingly quick on his feet, and a practiced hand with the oddly ornate rapier he keeps by his side. His accent is hard to place, and in forgetful moments he sometimes uses words more appropriate for a courtly dinner than the dingey bars he favours. What is not an affectation is Theo's love of knowledge. He is determined to learn as much about the Old World as possible, and sees spreading this knowledge as being an inherent good in and of itself.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Theodosius was raised to be the next Baron von Loningbruck, a destiny he abandoned just shy of his 17th birthday to flee south over the Black Mountains to the Border Princes and ‘freedom’. Several years of such ‘freedom’ almost destroyed him, before he managed to slip north once more, travelling with a wandering motley troop. He ‘reinvented’ himself several times as he travelled from place to place before writing a well-received book on mounts (mostly focusing on horses with some vaguely useful material on Pegasus and Demigryphs) as ‘Theodosius Schreiber’ and settling in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}.

Very smart. But can smart words beat Vasya's axe?’</p></blockquote><p>Vasya is tall, well muscled, and prefers to keep his head shaved bare. He enjoys little more than a good fight, especially now that he picks his own battles. He has known very little but fighting for much of his adult life, and frames all things through a lens of expectant violence. Vasya is much more than a bloodthirsty brawler, however. His career as a Pit Fighter taught him how to work a crowd, and he finds an easy smile and a biting quip easy to come by. While Vasya finds the idea of expedition to aquire unusual animals to be quite sensible and appealing, he does not fully understand what the Zoo intends to do with the animals. He assumes that eventually someone — ideally Vasya — will get to fight them.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Vasya was born a villager in a desolate area of Ostermark, squarely between the Dead Wood (where the ruins of dread Mordheim lie) and the Eerie Downs (which border Sylvania). His parents were slain by ‘things’ from the Dead Wood when he was a teen and he only survived by destroying one with a rock. The thing's corpse landed on Vasya, hiding him from the others. His Uncle Dima took him in and soon realized the boy was a fighter born. Dima turned his nephew into a lucrative Pit Fighter, setting him to wrestling bears and other, stranger creatures. Eventually, after years of progressively deadlier bouts, Vasya realised his uncle was using him and was, in fact, becoming increasingly scared of him — choosing more and more deadly matches in the hopes of getting him killed. He confronted Dima and ended up killing him, leaving Ostermark soon thereafter for @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}.</p><h3>Secrets</h3><p><span style=\"font-family: CaslonPro\">Your core secret is part of your Character, but you may choose additional secrets.
