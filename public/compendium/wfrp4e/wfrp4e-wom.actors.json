Vaguely humanoid, they are comprised of mud, bones, branches, and slime, and require significant quantities of magic to retain their integrity. Occasionally, they are raised by wizards skilled in Jade magic to act as a bodyguard or to fulfil a specific task requiring brute strength or mindless killing. Sometimes they rise independently, spawned in stagnant festering pools where the ﬂow of magic has been corrupted.

A great totem formed of beast skulls and freshly flensed pelts is required to power these rituals, leading Amber Wizards to refer to the creature as The Bloody Hidesman. Other names for this titanic entity are the Horned Man and the Faceless Hunter.</p><p>The elemental is a gigantic humanoid figure swollen with powerful muscles and crisscrossed with sinews like whipcords. Its head is a skull armed with sabre teeth and sweeping antlers. Its foreclaws are an eagle’s talons and it rears up on hind legs like those of a lion.</p><p>The elemental contains within it the spirit of numberless predators — animalistic and cruel, unrestrained and bloodthirsty. It seeks to chase down anything that it regards as entering its territory, maul them until their struggles cease, and then glut itself upon their body and blood. The elemental’s howling fills those who hear it with terror, awakening in them an ancestral memory of the might of primal predators.</p></section>"

The Incarnate Elemental of Death is a terrifying apparition, bearing the heads of lean and hungry Dragons at either end of a massive and twisted serpentine body.</p><p>Although it is monstrous in proportion the elemental makes no sound, save for a soft susurrus, the eerie whisperings of the grave, following in its wake. Unlike other Incarnate Elementals, the Incarnate Elemental of Death is known by no other names, for it is rarely conjured and those who know how to call it forth (the spiriters of the @UUID[JournalEntry.hFQtvGpxh0D8Xfcl.JournalEntryPage.daD4ol3xeaOgeizW]{Amethyst Order}) are too respectful of it to refer to it as anything other than what it is.</p><p>The Incarnate Elemental of Death is bound to the mortal realm by the power held within a rare <em>Shyish</em> horologe — an enchanted hourglass that contains the dust of a monarch’s bones. It serves as a powerful arcane focus and this artefact alone can contain the straining power of such an unnatural entity.</p><p>Those versed in the Lore of <em>Shyish</em> claim that anyone who meets the gaze of an Incarnate Elemental of Death witnesses their own destruction — but those who get so close are surely lost already. Rearing up on its sinuous body the elemental strikes with a speed few can escape, crushing its foes beneath the coils of its twisting body or ripping them apart with its monstrous jaws.</p></section>"

It is said that the Incarnate Elementals of Fire born from it possess a terrible wrath and fury only matched by Daemons.</p><p>Known in magical lore as the Charred Ones, the Black Harvestmen, and Jack O’Cinders, the Incarnate Elemental of Fire towers over the battlefield. It possesses a lean and terrible form, cinder black and ash strewn, from which phenomenal heat radiates. Few can withstand the elemental’s wrath and it can unleash a fire storm that turns armour into molten slag and causes artillery to explode, sending red hot shards of metal slicing through the air and the flesh of those who stand nearby.</p><p>Incarnate Elementals of Fire are so destructive and difficult to control that they are rarely seen. Even the more reckless magisters of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wjJ2wq1bzzON74vV.JournalEntryPage.QHqglxxZ0Ii2mPRy]{Bright Order}, an organisation with no shortage of rash practitioners, are reluctant to summon one even in dire circumstances.

Local barons tear down the effigies if they find them.
