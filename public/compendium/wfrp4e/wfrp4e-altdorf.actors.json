The slum-dwellers pay her protection, and in return she eats their best food and allows her sons to take what they want from their homes.

Besides, the war chiefs know it can occasionally be useful to have someone so notorious on their side.</p>\n<p>Honoria&rsquo;s nickname &lsquo;the Rat Queen&rsquo; comes from the voluminous ratskin cloak that she wears over her corpulent frame.

			"name": "Warchief Brruxx Chittirr",
			"description": "<p>Brruxx is an unusual Skaven leader. His piebald fur, scrawny fame, and tangible air of anxiety are signs of weakness that would usually prevent a Skaven from earning any form of status. Yet, he has managed operations in @JournalEntry[sMr6WBgGNEWN8oWn]{Under-Altdorf} in the name of Clan Mors for several years now without serious opposition. Perhaps this is due to a combination of careful planning and extreme paranoia, or his bribery of secret agents within Clan Eshin and Clan Scrutens. More likely is that no one else wants the job.</p>\n<p>Lord Gnawdwell of Clan Mors is satisfied with Brruxx&rsquo;s performance and the steady stream of slaves that come his way from the Reikland. Brruxx may have none of the courage and prowess of Gnawdwell&rsquo;s favoured prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, but this is to the Lord of Decay&rsquo;s immense gratification. After all, Gnawdwell believes that the weedy warchief is unlikely to make a bid for greater power. Those closer to Brruxx suspect he has a key component that every Skaven leader simply must possess: a great quantity of luck. He has a habit of staggering free from cave-ins, assassination attempts, slave stampedes, and outbreaks of Red Pox. The Horned Rat surely regards him, for all his apparent mediocrity.</p>"

			"description": "<p>@JournalEntry[gQ1XivfRcVfojOGg]{The Dockside Gangs}</p>\n<p>In his late 60s, but still brawny and very powerful; few people can remember a time when Willi Pick wasn&rsquo;t head of the Hooks. He was born in Altdorf &rsquo;s @JournalEntry[4YsFyNKWos4jMltD]{East End}, and as a youth he began working for the Hooks. Willi kept on the right side of the law for the most part, dedicating himself to working on, and then managing, the wharves and warehouses owned by the Hooks. Still he kept a careful log of the various injuries and grievances done to his fellows by the Fish and the Dock Watch. Willi was not a forgiving man.</p>\n<p>By his 30s Willi had changed; strong, smart, and willing to hurt anyone who crossed him, Willi made a perfect soldier. As he rose through the ranks, his example exacerbated the tensions between the gangs of Altdorf. The Waterfront War had many causes, but Willi was most certainly one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the outset of the war, the Hooks were led by many warchiefs, just as the Fish are. But Willi realised a more centralised structure would benefit the gang. His vision was taken up by his fellow Hooks, and those warchiefs who didn&rsquo;t agree with Willi&rsquo;s vision found themselves under considerable duress. These days Willi runs the Hooks unchallenged, and his project of legitimising the violent dockside gang in the eyes of Altdorf &rsquo;s authorities progresses steadily.</p>"

			"name": "Zavant Konniger",
			"description": "<p>Zavant Konniger is one of the Empire&rsquo;s finest investigators, with a wealth of scholarly knowledge, and a quick and deductive mind. His network of connections stretching from the palace to the underworld ensures efficient results. He is a strange sight: there is something vaguely barbaric about the style of his long white hair, though in his domed forehead and hawk-like nose he carries the bearing of the Professor Emeritus he once was. He is often accompanied by his assistant, Vido. Konniger derides Vido &rsquo;s practical and unlettered approach to problem solving, though he benefits from the Halfling&rsquo;s assistance more than he likes to admit.</p>\n<p>Once a member of the Cult of Sigmar, Konniger&rsquo;s open-mindedness and scepticism led to his dismissal. Whilst he was not convicted of heresy, he was labelled &lsquo;theologically suspect&rsquo;, and his relationship with the cult has become unclear. On one hand, it does not wish to be publicly associated with him, nor is it willing to reliably fund his research and investigations. On the other hand, it does recognise his expertise, and surreptitiously employs him through proxies in order to investigate matters of concern. For his part, Konniger is a loyal, if unorthodox, Sigmarite. He does not begrudge the cult his assistance, though he treats most priests with withering intellectual disdain. A public reconciliation between Konniger and the cult is a long way off.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>OPEN CASES&nbsp;</em></h3>\n<p><em>In a city like Altdorf there are always intrigues and murders to be investigated. Those affecting the upper classes might draw the eye of investigators such as Zavant, whilst those occurring in the slums might be made the subject of inquiry by the @JournalEntry[E7vJI4FcP8J4wm7p]{Atrocities Komission}. Either way, the Characters may be drawn in to help solve the mystery.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Wolfgardt Raus, the new head valet at the @JournalEntry[cjiKdr4N1IJJ3qsh]{von Ekstein} estate, was badly injured handling a soup tureen that had been heated to a dangerous degree. He blames anti-Ulrican elements within the staff, and is comforted in his anguish by the butler, Josef, a fellow Ulrican. In fact Josef, who fears that Wolfgardt plans to replace him, is the culprit.</em></p>\n<p><em>A band of merchants have returned from a hunting expedition in low spirits. One of their fellows, Dalberta Muller, was shot from her horse. What looks like an accident is actually part of a plot by members of the @JournalEntry[sPn5UYa9IF4ujquc]{League of Karl-Franz} to remind the middle classes to keep their place.</em></p>\n<p><em>A recently arrived Estalian traveller is found dead at his boarding house without a mark on his body. The Watch are baffled, but members of Altdorf&rsquo;s criminal class suggest that a man called Cicuta from Miragliano has recently been boasting about his skills with poison. Cicuta is still at large, but how can someone who kills without trace be tried for murder?&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>A pattern killer stalks the docks, choosing their victims from among the Hooks. The suspicion falls immediately on the @JournalEntry[gQ1XivfRcVfojOGg]{Fish gang}, and @Actor[eZUsF9PuQQn2cPPZ]{Breem} in particular. However, those who know Breem figure this isn&rsquo;t her MO (the killings are nowhere near sadistic and messy enough). The true killer is an assassin hired by @Actor[SfGYRLURc8WJmd3J]{Willi Pick} to help him with his house-clearing operations.</em></p>\n<p><em>After a vagrant turns up floating downstream from Altdorf with his throat slit, even the Atrocities Komission is about to give up on the crime. The only clue is a tattoo of a red skull, inscribed on the corpse post-mortem. It is surely of ritual significance, but is one cult trying to frame another?</em></p>\n</blockquote>"

She has the poise and commanding presence of her Gospodar forebears, but her dense black hair and big brown eyes suggest Ungol heritage too. Zofia&rsquo;s parents certainly claimed that they could trace their heritage back to Khan Queen Miska herself. Though, if this is true, their branch of the family has fallen into destitution since. Maybe the legacy of the Khan Queen has left its mark on Zofia, for she shows great aptitude for magic.</p>\n<p>As a Kislevite magic user with rather frosty airs, many assume Zofia must harbour sympathies with the Ice Witches of Kislev, or even have ambitions to become one herself. This assumption could not be further from the truth, for she abhors witchcraft. Her mastery of Hysh is in line with her personality: harsh, difficult, and pure in its defiance of Chaos.</p>\n<p>Zofia has never heard of the @JournalEntry[hH23kBdBqpzBgo6I]{Cult of the Vengeful Blaze}, but @JournalEntry[uj5OoiBU8emZtO6d]{Mornan Tybalt} is aware of her.
