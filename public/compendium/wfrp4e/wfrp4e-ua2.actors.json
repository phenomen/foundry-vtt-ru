When the abbess herself arrives, she screams as she did when her body was broken beneath the cairn. She is a terrifying sight, resplendent in her priestly vestments but wearing her ram&rsquo;s skull mask, its jaws gaping wide with her soul-tearing wails.</p>\n<p>The abbess only wants vengeance on the living.

He was always violent and slow-witted, but he respected his family&rsquo;s authority and acumen. When he was disinherited in favour of his sister Shalgrid, he went berserk, slaughtered many of his soldiers and retainers and tried to rebel against his father. He ended up imprisoned in the war dogs&rsquo; pens for two years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He snapped. He fought his way to be pack leader of the dogs, and when released he recognised Shalgrid as his owner. Now he&rsquo;s loyal to the family, but only because he knows they can be more brutal than him.</p>\n<p>Absolem is a giant of a man, fully 7 feet tall and heavily muscled. His face and bald scalp are scarred from dog bites and fights he&rsquo;s won over the years. He rarely removes his armour, carries a spiked warhammer, and keeps three semi-tame warhounds with him as he walks around the village. He boasts that they are part Hobhound and he ripped out their father&rsquo;s throat with his own teeth.</p>\n<p>If the Characters meet Absolem, he tries to recruit the good fighters, bully the rest, and destroy any possible threats. Absolem is only restrained by orders from Lady Shalgrid sent via @Actor[gdaMZK3R8I0jcRxW]{Greta} or the subtle intervention of his second-in-command @Actor[JiMqU4nNuE1bDiC9]{Vidar Skarost}.</p>"

He is a slight man who speaks Reikspeil with a clipped Sylvanian accent. He wears heavy dark clothing, which particularly contrasts with his skin, as it is roughly the colour of alabaster. He lost his right eye long ago to a Witch Hunter&rsquo;s blade, and the empty socket has since filled with a pale nascent green glow that he masks with an eyepatch on his exceedingly rare forays in public.</p>"

The resemblance is skin deep. Where @Actor[KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Sigismund the Elder} is domineering and shrewd, his son is easily swayed and prone to sentiment.

The legacy of the Emperor&rsquo;s betrayal drives every action the duke takes, and what the duke commands is expected to happen.</p>\n<p>For his entire life, Sigismund has known success. Born into a wealthy Reikland family, secure in his position, he proved himself as a statesman at a young age, using intelligence and pragmatism to forge alliances and temper rivalries with other Reikland families and the Dwarfs of @Compendium[wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}. When his father mishandled raids by Greenskin armies, he showed his mettle as a warrior and led his regiments to turn around the fortunes of Ubersreik. After succeeding to the title, he spearheaded construction projects within the city and across the hinterland which have improved trade and defence. At 54, Sigismund could look back at his life and take pride in all he&rsquo;d accomplished, thanks to his forceful personality and intimidating presence. He was a fair, strong ruler, liked by his people for his accomplishments if not his charm.</p>\n<p>The Sigismund of today is a shadow of his triumphant self. For the first time, he has faced true defeat, chased from his birthright, his family dissipated. Now he skulks in his draughty ancestral seat, struggling to come to terms with what happened.</p>\n<p>@Actor[34yRS0R4e4grG3Fj]{His eldest} son is in a marriage of convenience with a family the duke knows is beneath him and cannot be trusted. His @Actor[TKM7T6dQMde2jUWJ]{youngest son} is lost, possibly dead in Ubersreik.</p>\n<p>Where once he was known for his self-control and even temper, now Sigismund swings between moods. Some days he is hesitant and indecisive, unable to focus his attention on the business of the duchy or his plans to have revenge on Karl-Franz. At other times he becomes rash and impulsive. He launches dozens of schemes to undermine Altdorf and the Emperor, bombarding his eldest son and flunkies with impractical demands. The duke hasn&rsquo;t lost his intelligence &mdash; many of his plots could work, but this scattershot approach makes it unlikely. When a new plan fails or hits inevitable snags, he becomes paranoid. He assumes that Karl-Franz has spies in the castle or elsewhere in @JournalEntry[tlNuwBAFMCX4SBCE]{Black Rock} and wastes time trying to root them out.</p>\n<p>Dealing with Sigismund is difficult. Whatever mood one finds him in, he is swift to anger and without a sense of humour. He has no time for abstract thinking or pontificating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Until recently, Sigismund was as vigorous as a man half his age. Now he shows his years &mdash; his greying hair has receded further and his eyes are dark with lack of sleep. He still wears elegant but practical clothing &mdash; usually a slashed doublet and breeches in Jungfreud blue with a short fur-lined cloak.</p>"
