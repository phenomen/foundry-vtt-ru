An adult Neomorph typically dies of natural causes within 24 hours (four Shifts). Fungus interacting with the decaying corpse will be transformed into new spore sacs, continuing the cycle.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Adult Neomorphs go down quick with a full burst from a pulse rifle, but any automatic weapon does the job eventually. A finishing shot to the head is a good idea, as these creatures have been known to get up and attack even when they seem to be dead.\n\nSprint: As a slow action, the Neomorph can spring as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range from a target.",

When the creature's mouth closes, its jawline is imperceptible, giving it an inquisitive, ethereal appearance. When provoked, the adult Neomorph's upper jaw protrudes in a manner similar to a goblin shark, allowing it to grasp prey and pull it in for the kill. As adults they utilize stealth tactics to hunt their prey, but they are still voracious carnivores.</p>",

The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient-and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period-the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range.

The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation.

However, as Aliens have been observed surviving the vacuum of space, it is possible that they do not need to breathe at all.</p>\n<p>Sometimes called Lurkers, Drones stand 2.4 meters tall, and are stealthy ambush hunters.

Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\n\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off.

The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient-and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period-the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.",

			"special": "Класс защиты от огня: 2\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nEmbryo Implantation: Weyland-Yutani surgical scientist Dr. Matshulta believes that a Facehugger deposits a Chestburster embryo within its victim, making them the same species. Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\n\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

			"notes": "<p>Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xenomorph designed for one task only-the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacks, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host's face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature's throat. There are several different Facehugger types which appear to vary only slightly in appearance.

			"notes": "<p>Large leathery objects, Ovomorphs are the beginning of the alien life cycle. They come in various sizes from 0.6 to 1.2 meters tall. While most open with four petals at the top, some only have a single slit that opens to reveal the Facehugger it carries within. These eggs are lifeforms in their own right, able to protect their precious cargo from blunt trauma and forced entry, while also sensing movement and awakening the parasite within accordingly. Naturally occuring alien eggs are generated in one of two forms-either they are the result of a transformation perpetuated on a living host, causing it to metamorphose into an Ovomorph, or they are simply birthed by a Queen. Queen produced eggs are hardier and healthier than those produced through ovomorphing.</p>",

The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier's carapace is armored enough to shurg off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you'll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive. Period.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping.
